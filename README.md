# softwareclonesfiles
identification of software cloned files are necessary because cloned files prone to increase in bugs in code so our project suggest a unique learning method to identify the cloned files and help developers for refactoring using machine learning techniques.here we use 4 different machine learning techniques i.e.KNN,SVM,Bagging and Random Forest and make a comparative study among the 4 algorithms ans suggest the developer that gives best accuracy,recall,F-measure and precision.
